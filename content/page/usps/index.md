### Secure Bitcoin storage made Easy

#### Label Synchronization and Backup

<img  src="/images/logo.svg" width="20"> Bitcoin Safe will magically  (through the power of encrypted  <a href="https://nostr.com/ ">nostr</a> messages) 
- synchronize your coin categories and labels across computers
- backup your coin categories and labels.  You only have to backup a short secret key.

See <a  href="/page/syncchat" role="button">Demo</a>.

#### Multi-party Multi-sig collaboration

Have a 3-of-5 Multi-sig wallet between multiple participants?

After the wallet is created <img  src="/images/logo.svg" width="20"> Bitcoin Safe creates an encrypted group chat to collaborate and   send PSBTs around to sign. 

Label synchronization  works of course too.

#### Removing possibilities for mistakes

- People have made many expensive mistakes in the past. Most of them can be prevented if people **never**  type a seed into a computer. <img  src="/images/logo.svg" width="20"> Bitcoin Safe prevents you from using  seeds on your computer, and encourages you to use a hardware signer.

- <img  src="/images/logo.svg" width="20"> Bitcoin Safe  has full support for the most common hardware signers (e.g.  <a href="https://store.coinkite.com/promo/8BFF877000C34A86F410">Coldcard</a>,

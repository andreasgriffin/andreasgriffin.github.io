### ✔ Secure Bitcoin storage made Easy 
<!-- - ❌ 2-of-3 Multisignature is complex to use in other wallets -->
<!-- - 2-of-3 Multi-signature is a good choice  
    - Robust against loss or leak of 1 seed  -->
- The {{<text-name-with-logo>}} <a  href={{< ref "knowledge/setup-singlesig-wallet" >}} role="button">setup wizard</a>    makes Single and  Multi-signature **easy**   for non-technical people
    --> Simply follow each step to set up a safe wallet.   
    <img  src="/images/multisig-steps.png" style="max-width: 600px; width: 100%;">
    - The <a  href={{< ref "features/pdf-export" >}}   role="button"> <img  src="pdf-export.png" width="100">  PDF Export</a>   helps you to backup the important wallet descriptor with each seed.
    - Register the Multi-signature with each hardware signer 
    - Includes test receiving and spending from the wallet, to ensure all major hardware signers work

#### ✔ Label Synchronization and Backup

{{<text-name-with-logo>}} will magically  (through the power of encrypted  <a href="https://nostr.com/ ">nostr</a> messages) 
- <a  href="{{< ref "features/label-sync" >}}" role="button">Synchronize</a> your coin categories and labels across computers
- Backup your coin categories and labels.  All you have to do is  backup a short backup-key.
 

<br>

####  ✔ Multi-party Multi-sig collaboration

Participate in a 3-of-5 Multi-sig wallet?

- After the wallet is created {{<text-name-with-logo>}} creates an encrypted <a href="https://nostr.com/ ">nostr</a> group chat  to collaborate and  <a  href="{{< ref "features/collaboration" >}}" role="button">send PSBTs</a>  around to sign. 
-  <a  href="{{< ref "features/label-sync" >}}" role="button">Label synchronization</a>  works of course too.
- For security each participant has to authenticate (a simple click) each other user


<br>


#### ✔ Organize addresses in coin categories

 <img  src="coin-categories.png" width="150"> 
 
- You can cluster addresses in **coin categories**. It's easier than labeling each address.
- For each PSBT you create you select the matching coin category and {{<text-name-with-logo>}}   will select the inputs only from it.   
- {{<text-name-with-logo>}}   warns if a PSBT or transaction combines coin categories.


<br>


#### ✔ Removing possibilities for mistakes

People have made many expensive mistakes in the past. Most of them can be prevented if people **never**  type a seed into a computer. {{<text-name-with-logo>}} prevents you from using  seeds on your computer, and encourages you to use a hardware signer.

- {{<text-name-with-logo>}}  has full support for the most common hardware signers (e.g.  <a href="https://store.coinkite.com/promo/8BFF877000C34A86F410">Coldcard</a>, 
            <a href="https://store.coinkite.com/promo/8BFF877000C34A86F410">Coldcard Q</a>, 
            <a href="https://shop.bitbox.swiss/?ref=MOB4dk7gpm">Bitbox02</a>,

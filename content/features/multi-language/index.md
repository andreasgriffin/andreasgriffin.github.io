### {{< page-title >}}  
  
So far we support over 21 languages {{< flags-short >}}

Borders are fiction, a creation of governments. Bitcoin is borderless — and Bitcoin-Safe is built to match. With support for over 21 languages, including English, Chinese, Spanish, Japanese, Russian, Arabic, French, German, Korean, and many more, Bitcoin-Safe puts secure cold storage within reach for users around the world, regardless of where they live or what language they speak. You can add your language or improve existing translations [here](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/bitcoin-safe/).  

Alongside full multi-language support, Bitcoin-Safe lets you view your balance in any local fiat currency (or gold and silver if you prefer) so you always have a clear, familiar reference point for your holdings. Whether you're a first-time user in São Paulo or an experienced holder in Seoul, or anywhere else in the world, Bitcoin-Safe speaks your language — and thinks in your currency.

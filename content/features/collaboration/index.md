### {{< page-title >}}  
  
 
 Collaborative signing of a 2-of-3 Multisig wallet using Bitcoin Safe — across different computers, hardware wallets, and secure communication via Nostr.

This video shows how two users collaboratively sign a Bitcoin transaction using a 2-of-3 multisig wallet setup in Bitcoin Safe. Each participant is on a different computer, using different hardware wallets (Jade and Bitbox02). They coordinate through the app’s built-in Chat & Sync feature, which uses Nostr to relay messages privately and securely.

The process supports both synchronous and asynchronous signing — perfect for users who aren’t online at the same time.

## Code signing policy


Free code signing provided by [SignPath.io](https://about.signpath.io/), certificate by [SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.org/)


## Privacy policy
This program uses by default
- the electrum/esplora server of [blockstream.com](https://blockstream.com/) to fetch blockchain data
- fetches mempool fee information from [mempool.space](https://mempool.space/)

You can specify your own (personal) server for both in "Network settings".

When enabeling the Sync&Chat feature [default relays](https://github.com/andreasgriffin/bitcoin-nostr-chat/blob/main/bitcoin_nostr_chat/default_relays.py) are used to transmit encrypted data to your approved trusted devices. You can specify your own relay(s) in the Sync&Chat settings.

This program will not transfer any other information to other networked systems unless specifically requested by the user or the person installing or operating it.

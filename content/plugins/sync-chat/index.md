### {{< page-title >}}

Coordinate signers without leaving the wallet: discover other devices on the same wallet descriptor in one click, sync labels/categories, chat inline, and pass PSBTs without juggling files. That keeps wallets aligned and makes multisig collaboration smoother.

- One-click discovery of peers using the same wallet descriptor
- Encrypted chat scoped to the wallet/policy for real-time coordination
- Label and category sync so every signer sees identical context
- One-click PSBT sharing to cut down on file passing and back-and-forth
- Works both for keeping wallets in sync and for full multisig approval flows

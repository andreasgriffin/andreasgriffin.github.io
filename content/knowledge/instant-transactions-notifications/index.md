### {{< page-title >}}  
 
  


**Bitcoin Safe** (starting from version **1.5.0**) supports instant notification of incoming Bitcoin transactions relevant to your wallet. Here‚Äôs how it works under the hood:




##### 1. üì° Listening to the Bitcoin P2P Network

Bitcoin Safe connects directly to one or more **Bitcoin Core nodes**, which participate in the global **peer-to-peer (P2P)** network. These nodes continuously exchange newly broadcasted transactions intended for inclusion in the **mempool**.

Bitcoin Safe listens passively to these broadcast messages and checks whether:

* any transaction involves **addresses** or **UTXOs** from your wallet.

‚úÖ **Privacy Preserving**
This method is **completely private**. It does **not reveal anything** about your wallet to the outside world.
Bitcoin Safe behaves just like a regular Bitcoin Core node: it only listens to public P2P traffic ‚Äî never announcing or requesting anything specific to your wallet.



##### 2. üß† Match Found ‚Äî What Happens Next?

If a matching transaction is found, Bitcoin Safe will react differently depending on the backend you're using:

###### Option A: ‚ö° Electrum or Esplora Backend

* Bitcoin Safe will **trigger a background sync** to fetch the full transaction and wallet state from the server.

###### Option B: üîç Compact Block Filters (Neutrino Mode)

* The wallet will **directly add the unconfirmed transaction** to your local wallet data ‚Äî no further lookup needed.



#### ‚öôÔ∏è Opt-In / Opt-Out Behavior

To respect user preferences and privacy settings:

* üîí **For existing users** upgrading to version 1.5.0 or later, this feature is **opt-in by default** ‚Äî you can enable it manually in network settings.
* üöÄ **For new users**, this feature is **enabled (opt-out)** by default, since it is both **privacy-preserving** and **highly useful** for tracking wallet activity in real-time.

You remain in full control and can toggle this feature at any time.
 
 


#### ‚ö†Ô∏è  Only confirmed transactions can be trusted

Bitcoin Safe cannot **not** validate that a broadcast transaction is valid. An attacker ‚Äî especially one controlling both your Electrum server and the Bitcoin node you're connected to ‚Äî could:

* Craft a fake transaction involving your address
* Broadcast it to trigger a wallet notification
* Ensure it never confirms, because it‚Äôs **invalid** or **conflicts with consensus rules**


  


#### ‚úÖ Summary

From version **1.5.0**, Bitcoin Safe supports instant transaction notifications by:

* Listening passively to the P2P Bitcoin network (like Bitcoin Core)
* Matching transactions involving your wallet's **addresses** or **UTXOs**
* Fetching full details via Electrum/Esplora or adding directly via Compact Block Filters
* Never revealing any wallet data to the outside world

Dive into the revolutionary world of Bitcoin in this comprehensive introductory course. Explore the evolution of money, understand the inherent flaws of traditional fiat currencies, and learn how Bitcoin offers a decentralized, finite alternative. We begin with powerful insights from Henry Ford and Ludwig von Mises to frame our discussion on moneyâ€™s true value and its impact on society. In this video, you'll discover the consequences of inflation, shrinkflation, and quality deterioration in fiat systems, and see how Bitcoinâ€™s transparent blockchain and peer-to-peer network address these issues. Whether you're new to Bitcoin or looking to deepen your understanding, join us as we break down the basicsâ€”from creating a Bitcoin wallet to using the Lightning Network for fast, secure transactions. Subscribe for more in-depth content on digital currency, blockchain technology, and financial innovation.
